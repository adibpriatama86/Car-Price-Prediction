# Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about various car brands, models, and features.

## Dataset

- Brand
- Model
- Year
- Engine_Size
- Fuel_Type
- Transmission
- Mileage
- Doors
- Owner_Count
- Price

## Steps
1. Data Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Training
4. Evaluation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
