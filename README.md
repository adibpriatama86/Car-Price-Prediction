- Brand
- Model
- Year
- Engine_Size
- Fuel_Type
- Transmission
- Mileage
- Doors
- Owner_Count
- Price

## Steps
1. Data Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Training
4. Evaluation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook `car_price_prediction.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
